    "# URL\n",
    "The url is the address of a resource on the internet that you are trying to access. We have been using it so far to point the `requests` library as target for it's requests. But what is a url?\n",
    "\n",
    "### URL Components\n",
    "The url is a string that is made up of certain parts:  the `protocol`, `domain`, `path`. \n",
    "For example, the url `https://www.google.com/search` is made up of the following components:\n",
    "- `https` is the protocol\n",
    "- `www.google.com` is the domain\n",
    "- `/search` is the path\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The path is optional. If no path is specified, the default path is `/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: the concept of url is not http specific. It is used by other protocols as well. For example the [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) library uses a url string to connect to a database. the url for a database connection is made up of the same components as the url for a http request. The only difference is that the protocol is different. For example, the url for a database connection might look like this: `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase`. The url is `parsed` by the library and understand which driver to use to connect to the database and which database to connect to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another element of a url is the `query string`. The query string is a set of key-value pairs that are used to pass `additional information` to the server. The query string is separated from the path by a `?`. For example, the url `https://www.google.com/search?q=python` has a query string of `q=python`.\n",
    " - `q` is the key\n",
    " - `python` is the value\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: In the above example, we are using the `q` key to search for the term `python`. the server will use the value of the `q` key do parameterize the search. In this case the server will search for the term `python`.\n",
    "\n",
    " We can also have multiple key-value pairs in the query string. For example, the url `https://www.google.com/search?q=python&num=10` has a query string of `q=python&num=10`.\n",
    "\n",
    " Usually, the server can understand a predefined set of query parametres. Depending on the server, the query parameters can be used to filter the results, sort the results, or paginate the results or any other purpose. Including making the server return a status code of 404 (Not Found) if the query parameters are not understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing Parameters to the Server using Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The above behavious is a core element of HTTP communication. As such the `requests` library provides a way to pass parameters to the server programatically when you construct the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: You can construct the query params by hand, but is not recommended, and error prone."

    "### requests sessions\n",
    "So far our methods (.get() and .post()) have been creating a new connection to the server for each request. \n",
    "This is not very efficient mainly for two reasons. The first is that with each _normal_ request, the remote connection is closed and re-opens everytime. That adds a lot of overhead. The effect is noticeable, when you the numbers of requests of some workflows that need to run a large amount of requests/response cycles. The second reasons is that you can preconfigure the sessions, with default values, i.e headers or keep the cookies.  \n",
