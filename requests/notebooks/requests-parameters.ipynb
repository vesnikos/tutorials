    "# URL\n",
    "The url is the address of a resource on the internet that you are trying to access. We have been using it so far to point the `requests` library as target for it's requests. But what is a url?\n",
    "\n",
    "### URL Components\n",
    "The url is a string that is made up of certain parts:  the `protocol`, `domain`, `path`. \n",
    "For example, the url `https://www.google.com/search` is made up of the following components:\n",
    "- `https` is the protocol\n",
    "- `www.google.com` is the domain\n",
    "- `/search` is the path\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The path is optional. If no path is specified, the default path is `/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: the concerpt of url is not http specific. It is used by other protocols as well. For example the [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) library uses a url string to connect to a database. the url for a database connection is made up of the same components as the url for a http request. The only difference is that the protocol is different. For example, the url for a database connection might look like this: `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase`. The url is `parsed` by the library and understand which which driver to use to connect to the database and which database to connect to. The following are still apply to parametise the connection accoding to our needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another element of a url is the `query string`. The query string is a set of key-value pairs that are used to pass `additional information` to the server. The query string is separated from the path by a `?`. For example, the url `https://www.google.com/search?q=python` has a query string of `q=python`.\n",
    " - `q` is the key\n",
    " - `python` is the value\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: In the above example, we are using the `q` key to search for the term `python`. the server will use the value of the `q` key do parameterize the search. In this case the server will search for the term `python`.\n",
    "\n",
    " We can also have multiple key-value pairs in the query string. For example, the url `https://www.google.com/search?q=python&num=10` has a query string of `q=python&num=10`.\n",
    "\n",
    " Usually the server can understand a predefined set of query parametres. Depending on the server, the query parameters can be used to filter the results, sort the results, or paginate the results or any other purpose. Including making the server return a status code of 404 (Not Found) if the query parameters are not understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing Parameters to the Server using Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The above behavious is a core element of HTTP communication. As such the `requests` library provides a way to pass parameters to the server programatically when you construct the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: You can construct the query params by hand, but is not recommended, and error prone."

    "\n",
    "The UBDC CCTV API is a REST API that provides access to the cctv counts of objects (people, cars, bikes and and more) generated using images from the city's cctv network. these images were processed using a ML model to extract these counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: If you're intrested in the process you should talk to Luis Serra (luis.serra@glasgow.ac.uk), who developed the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The API is hosted on the UBDC server and is accessible from anywhere on the internet. The API is documented using the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/). The documentation is available at the following url: https://glasgow-cctv.ubdc.ac.uk/docs/\n",
    "\n",
    "in the documentation, we can see that the API has a number of endpoints. Each endpoint is a url that we can use to access a resource on the server. For example, the endpoint `/cameras` is used to get a list of all the cameras. The endpoint `/cameras/{camera_id}` is used to get the details of a specific camera. The endpoint `/cameras/{camera_id}/image` is used to get the latest image from a specific camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: the curly braces `{}` indicate that the value of the parameter is variable. For example, the endpoint `/cameras/{camera_id}` is used to get the details of a specific camera. The value of the `camera_id` parameter is variable. We can use any value for the `camera_id` parameter. For example, we can use the value `1` to get the details of the camera with id `1`. We can also use the value `2` to get the details of the camera with id `2`. We can also use the value `3` to get the details of the camera with id `3`. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we click on the endpoint `/cameras/records` in the documention page we can see that the endpoint has a query parameter `page`. The query parameter `page` is used to specify the page of the results. The endpoint `/cameras/records` returns a list of records. The list of records is paginated. The query parameter `page` is used to specify which page of the results we want to get. For example, if we want to get the first page of the results, we can use the url `https://glasgow-cctv.ubdc.ac.uk/cameras/records?page=1`. If we want to get the second page of the results, we can use the url `https://glasgow-cctv.ubdc.ubdc.ac.uk/cameras/records?page=2`. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other parameters exist as well. For example, the above endoint has the parameter 'camera_id'. That parameter is used to specify the camera that we want to get the records for. For example, if we want to get the records for the camera with id `1`, we can use the url `https://glasgow-cctv.ubdc.ac.uk/cameras/records?camera_id=1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The query parameters are optional. If we don't specify a query parameter, the server will use a default value for that parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "if we want to fetch information about the cameras, we can do so by using the endpoint `/cameras`. The endpoint `/cameras` has no query parameters, and returns a json object with a list of all the cameras. For example, if we want to get a list of all the cameras, we can use the url `https://glasgow-cctv.ubdc.ac.uk/cameras`. The response will be a json object with a list of all the cameras alont with metadata about each camera (ie location and label)."
